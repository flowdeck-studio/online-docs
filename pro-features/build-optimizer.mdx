FlowDeck Includes a Build Optimizer Helper that significantly improves Xcode build performance by intelligently managing network connections to Apple's developer services during builds.

## Installation

The Build Optimizer requires one-time installation of a privileged helper tool:

1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (⌘⇧P)
2. Type and select "FlowDeck: Install Build Optimizer"
3. Authenticate with your macOS password when prompted
4. The helper will be installed as a system service

You'll be prompted to install the Build Optimizer automatically if FlowDeck detects that builds could be optimized.

## Commands

FlowDeck provides several commands for managing the Build Optimizer:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `FlowDeck: Install Build Optimizer` | Install the Build Optimizer helper tool |
| `FlowDeck: Uninstall Build Optimizer` | Remove the Build Optimizer helper tool |
| `FlowDeck: Check Xcode Optimizer Status` | Verify if the optimizer is installed and working |
| `FlowDeck: Test Build Optimizer` | Run a diagnostic test of the optimizer |
| `FlowDeck: Show Build Optimizer Logs` | Display logs related to the Build Optimizer |
| `FlowDeck: Repair Build Optimizer Installation` | Fix installation issues with the helper tool |

## Security Considerations

The Build Optimizer uses a privileged helper tool to modify system files:

- The helper is digitally signed and follows Apple's security guidelines
- Installation requires administrator authentication
- The tool only modifies specific entries in the hosts file
- All changes are temporary and automatically reversed
- The source code for the helper is open and available for inspection

## Performance Impact

The Build Optimizer can significantly impact build performance:

- **Initial Builds**: Typically 10-20% faster
- **Incremental Builds**: Up to 30% faster
- **Clean Builds**: 15-25% faster on average

Actual performance gains vary based on project complexity, network conditions, and Apple's developer services responsiveness.

## Uninstallation

To remove the Build Optimizer:

1. Open Command Palette (⌘⇧P)
2. Execute `FlowDeck: Uninstall Build Optimizer`
3. Authenticate with your macOS password when prompted

This will completely remove the helper tool from your system.
