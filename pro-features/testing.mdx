## VSCode Test Explorer Integration

FlowDeck integrates seamlessly with VSCode's built-in Test Explorer, providing:

### Test Discovery
- **Automatic Discovery**: Tests are discovered automatically when you open a project
- **Background Refresh**: Test structure updates in the background when schemes change
- **Hierarchical Display**: Tests are organized by target → class → method structure

### Test Execution
- **Individual Tests**: Click the play button next to any test method
- **Test Classes**: Run all tests in a class by clicking the class play button
- **Test Targets**: Run entire test suites by clicking the target play button
- **Real-time Updates**: Test status updates live during execution

### Navigation
- **Click to Source**: Click on any test name to navigate directly to the source code
- **Result Navigation**: Click on test results to jump to the test implementation
- **Error Navigation**: Failed tests show detailed error information with source links


### Building for Testing

To build your application for testing:

```
FlowDeck: Build for Testing
```

This will compile your application with test targets but won't execute the tests.

### Running Tests Without Building

If you've already built your application, you can run tests without rebuilding:

```
FlowDeck: Test Without Building
```
