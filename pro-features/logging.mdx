When debugging on physical iOS devices, FlowDeck integrates with macOS's built-in Console.app to view detailed logs from connected devices.

## Viewing Device Logs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Console.app">
    Open Console.app from Applications/Utilities or use Spotlight search
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your device">
    In the sidebar, find your connected device under the **Devices** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter logs">
    Enter your app's main library name in the search/filter field to filter logs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start streaming">
    Click the **Start** button to begin streaming live logs
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Console.app provides a powerful interface for viewing detailed device logs, system messages, and crash reports from your iOS devices.

## Best Practices

- Use predicate filters for specific results (e.g., `library contains "appname.dylib"`)
- Select **Debug** or **Default** log level for more detailed information
- Enable **Errors and Faults** and **Show Info Messages** for comprehensive logging
- Save log snapshots for later analysis using **File** → **Save**

## Troubleshooting

- **Device not appearing** - Disconnect and reconnect your device
- **Trust issues** - Ensure you've trusted the computer on your iOS device
- **iOS 17+ devices** - Enable Developer Mode in Settings → Privacy & Security
