# Viewing Device Logs in Console.app

When debugging on physical iOS devices, FlowDeck cannot directly capture device logs due to Apple's restrictions. However, you can use macOS's built-in Console.app to view detailed logs from connected devices.

## Steps to View Device Logs

1. Open Console.app (found in Applications/Utilities)
2. In the sidebar, select your connected device under the "Devices" section
3. In the search/filter field, enter your app's main library name to filter logs (You can copy from DeckFlow)
4. Click the "Start" button to begin streaming logs

<Note>
  Console.app provides a powerful interface for viewing detailed device logs, system messages, and crash reports.

## Tips for Effective Log Viewing

- Use predicate filters for more specific results, such as `library contains "appname.dyl"`
- The "Info" level often doesn't include enough detail - try selecting "Default" or "Debug" level from the dropdown menu
- For crash reports and detailed system logs, check both the "Errors and Faults" and "Show Info Messages" options
- You can save log snapshots for later analysis using File â†’ Save

## Common Issues

- If your device doesn't appear in the sidebar, try disconnecting and reconnecting it
- Ensure that you've trusted the computer on your iOS device when prompted
- For devices with iOS 17+, you may need to enable Developer Mode on the device
