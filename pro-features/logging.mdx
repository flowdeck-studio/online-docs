description: "Stream and filter logs directly in VS Code"
---

FlowDeck provides powerful OSLog integration that streams logs from simulators and devices directly within VS Code, eliminating the need to switch between your editor and Console.app.

## Features

- **Real-time Log Streaming** - View logs as they happen during app execution
- **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by log level, subsystem, category, or search text
- **Color-coded Output** - Different log levels displayed with distinct colors for quick scanning
- **Integrated Console** - Logs appear in VS Code's output panel alongside your code
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal impact on simulator and app performance
- **Export Capabilities** - Save filtered logs for later analysis

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Open your iOS/macOS project in VS Code with FlowDeck
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start your app">
    Build and run your app on a simulator or device
  </Step>
  <Step title="View logs">
    Open the Output panel and select **FlowDeck - OSLog** from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter as needed">
    Use the filter controls to focus on specific log messages
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Log Levels

FlowDeck displays all standard OSLog levels with color coding:

- ðŸ”´ **Error** - Critical errors requiring immediate attention
- ðŸŸ  **Fault** - System-level failures
- ðŸŸ¡ **Default** - Standard log messages
- ðŸ”µ **Info** - Informational messages
- âšª **Debug** - Detailed debugging information

## Filtering Options

### By Log Level
Select which log levels to display using the level selector in the FlowDeck panel.

### By Subsystem
Filter logs by your app's subsystem to focus on specific components:
```swift
Logger(subsystem: "com.yourapp.networking", category: "API")
```

### By Search Text
Use the search field to filter logs containing specific text or patterns.

## Using OSLog in Your Code

FlowDeck fully supports Apple's unified logging system. Here's how to use it effectively:

```swift
import os

// Create a logger
let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.yourapp.main", category: "UI")

// Log at different levels
logger.debug("Debug: View will appear")
logger.info("Info: User tapped button")
logger.error("Error: Failed to load data")
```

<Tip>
  Use structured logging for better filtering and analysis:
  ```swift
  logger.info("User \(userID, privacy: .private) completed action \(action)")
  ```
</Tip>

## Physical Device Logging

When working with physical devices, FlowDeck provides a convenient link to open Console.app with pre-configured filters for your app.

<Note>
  Due to Apple's security restrictions, physical device logs must be viewed through Console.app. FlowDeck makes this seamless by automatically configuring the correct filters.
</Note>

## Performance Tips

- Use appropriate log levels to reduce noise
- Disable verbose logging in production builds
- Use subsystems and categories for better organization
- Consider using signposts for performance analysis

## Troubleshooting

- **No logs appearing** - Ensure your app is using `os.log` or `Logger` APIs
- **Too many logs** - Adjust the filter level or add specific subsystem filters
- **Missing debug logs** - Check that your scheme's build configuration is set to Debug
