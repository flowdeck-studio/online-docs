Get started with FlowDeck's core features and learn how to build, run, and debug your iOS and macOS applications directly from VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.

FlowDeck brings the essential Xcode functionality to your favorite VS Code-based editor, allowing you to stay in your preferred development environment while building native Apple applications.

## Quick Start

1. **Open your project** - Use the command palette to open an existing `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`
2. **Select a device** - Choose a simulator or connected device from the status bar
3. **Build and run** - Use `Cmd+SHIFT-P` `R` or the build button to compile and launch your app
4. **Debug** - Set breakpoints and use the debug console for runtime inspection

<Note>
  Make sure you have Xcode and its command line tools installed before using FlowDeck. Check the [installation guide](/install-and-setup) for detailed requirements.
