## Quick Start

1. **Open your project** - Use the command palette to open an existing `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`
2. **Select a device** - Choose a simulator or connected device from the status bar
3. **Build and run** - Use `Cmd+R` or the build button to compile and launch your app
4. **Debug** - Set breakpoints and use the debug console for runtime inspection

<Note>
  Make sure you have Xcode and its command line tools installed before using FlowDeck. Check the [installation guide](/install-and-setup) for detailed requirements.
