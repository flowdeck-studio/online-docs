FlowDeck integrates with LLDB-DAP to provide a powerful debugging experience for Swift applications directly within VS Code, offering features comparable to Xcode's debugging capabilities.

## Features

- **Breakpoint Management** - Set, disable, and manage breakpoints
- **Variable Inspection** - Examine variable values during execution
- **Call Stack** - Explore threads and the entire app call stack
- **Console Output** - View application logs during debugging (OSLog)
- **Step Controls** - Step over, into, and out of functions
- **Expression Evaluation** - Evaluate Swift expressions in context

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Open your iOS project in VS Code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set breakpoints">
    Click in the gutter next to line numbers to set breakpoints
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose target">
    Select your scheme and target (simulator or device)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start debugging">
    Press `F5` and select **FlowDeck (LLDB)** from the list
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced: Launch Configuration

VS Code launch configurations define how to compile, run, and debug your code. They're specified through JSON files in the `.vscode` folder.

You can configure VS Code launch configurations via `.vscode/launch.json`:

1. Go to the VS Code Debug panel and click **Create a launch.json file**
2. Select **FlowDeck (LLDB)** from the list
3. A new file will be automatically created with default build and run settings

The automatic configuration includes:

- Proper LLDB adapter settings
- Pre-launch task integration
- Optimized presentation settings
- Environment variable support

### Example launch.json

```javascript
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        
        {
            "type": "flowdeck-lldb",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "FlowDeck: Build and Run (Debug)",
            "preLaunchTask": "flowdeck: launch",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "never"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
