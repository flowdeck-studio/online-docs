FlowDeck integrates with LLDB-DAP to provide a powerful debugging experience for Swift applications directly within VS Code, offering features comparable to Xcode's debugging capabilities.

## Debugging Features

- **Breakpoint Management** - Set, disable, and manage breakpoints
- **Variable Inspection** - Examine variable values during execution
- \*\*Call Stack - \*\*Explore Threads and the entire app call stack.
- **Console Output** - View application logs during debugging (OSLog)
- **Step Controls** - Step over, into, and out of functions
- **Expression Evaluation** - Evaluate Swift expressions in context

## Start the Debugger

1. Open your iOS project in VS Code
2. Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to line numbers
3. Choose your Scheme and Target (simulator or device)
4. Press `F5`
5. Select `FlowDeck (LLDB)` from the list.

### Automatic Launch Configuration Setup (Advanced)

VSCode build configurations are defined ways to compile, run, and debug your code. They're specified through JSON files in the `.vscode` folder and tell VSCode how to execute build tasks for your project.

You can configure VSCode launch configurations via a `.vscode/launch.json`file.

1. Go to VSCode `Debug` panel and click `Create a launch.json file`
2. Select FlowDeck (LLDB) from the list
3. A new file will be automatically created for you with default Build and Run Settings

This means you can start debugging immediately without any manual actions. The automatic configuration includes:

- Proper LLDB adapter settings
- Pre-launch task integration
- Optimized presentation settings
- Environment variable support

Example `.vscode/launch.json`file

```javascript
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        
        {
            "type": "flowdeck-lldb",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "FlowDeck: Build and Run (Debug)",
            "preLaunchTask": "flowdeck: launch",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "never"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
