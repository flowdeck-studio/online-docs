### From Command Palette

Build commands are also available via the Command palette:

- `⌘⇧P` -\> FlowDeck: Build
- `⌘⇧P` -\> FlowDeck: Build and Run

### Via Build Configuration Tasks (Advanced)

VSCode build configurations are defined ways to compile, run, and debug your code. They're specified through JSON files in the `.vscode` folder and tell VSCode how to execute build tasks for your project.

You can configure VSCode to run external Tasks via `.vscode/tasks.json`.  FlowDeck supports all build operations to be configured this way.

- To configure your first Build task, enter `⌘⇧B`
- Select the task you want to run by default
- FlowDeck will create a `.vscode/tasks.json` with the selected configuration.
- Once created, you can add multiple tasks assign different shortcuts or run specific ones by default.

For more info about Tasks, check out [VSCode Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks)

Example `.vscode/tasks.json` file:

```javascript
{
	"version": "2.0.0",
	"tasks": [
		{
			"type": "flowdeck",
			"action": "build",
			"problemMatcher": [
				"$flowdeck-watch",
				"$flowdeck-xcodebuild-default",
				"$flowdeck-xcbeautify-errors",
				"$flowdeck-xcbeautify-warnings"
			],
			"label": "flowdeck: build",
			"detail": "Build the app",
			"group": {
				"kind": "build",
				"isDefault": true
			}
		}
	]
}
