## Building from the Scheme Panel

Open the FlowDeck panel → Schemes and use the scheme actions:

- <Icon icon="wrench" /> **Build** - Compile your app
- <Icon icon="play" /> **Build and Run** - Compile and launch your app

## Building from Command Palette

Build commands are also available via the Command Palette:

- `⌘⇧P` → `FlowDeck: Build`
- `⌘⇧P` → `FlowDeck: Build and Run`

## Advanced: Build Configuration Tasks

VS Code build configurations are defined ways to compile, run, and debug your code. They're specified through JSON files in the `.vscode` folder and tell VS Code how to execute build tasks for your project.

You can configure VS Code to run external tasks via `.vscode/tasks.json`. FlowDeck supports all build operations to be configured this way.

1. To configure your first build task, press `⌘⇧B`
2. Select the task you want to run by default
3. FlowDeck will create a `.vscode/tasks.json` with the selected configuration
4. Once created, you can add multiple tasks, assign different shortcuts, or run specific ones by default

For more information about tasks, see the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks).
