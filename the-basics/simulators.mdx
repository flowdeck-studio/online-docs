FlowDeck provides integration with iOS simulators directly within VS Code, allowing you to manage and interact with simulators without switching to Xcode.

## Simulator Selection

You can select a default simulator as your build destination:

1. Use `FlowDeck: Select Destination` command
2. Choose your simulator device from the list
3. Build and run your app on the selected device

(You can also right-click the Simulator in FlowDeck's devices panel and select `Select destination`)

Flowdeck's simulator panel provides quick actions to Simulator commands.

- <Icon icon="map-pin" /> Select Simulator
- <Icon icon="play" /> Start Simulator
- <Icon icon="Stop" /> Stop Simulator
