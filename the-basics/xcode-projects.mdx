## Opening Existing Projects

FlowDeck supports both `.xcworkspace` and `.xcodeproj` projects, automatically detecting build settings, schemes, and build configurations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Folder">
    File → Open Folder → Select the folder containing your `.xcworkspace` or `.xcodeproj`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Workspace & Scheme">
    The first time you open a project, FlowDeck will ask you to select your preferred workspace and scheme, then configure the project settings automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a New Project

With FlowDeck, you can create and manage Xcode projects directly from VS Code.

As you add and remove files from your sources, FlowDeck will keep your Xcode project up to date.

1. Create a new folder and open it in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (`⌘⇧P`)
3. Run `FlowDeck: Create New Project`
4. Follow the prompts

   <Warning>
     **File Management coming soon...**\
     \
     While you can create projects, some operations like adding package dependencies or files to groups will require XCode.  \
     \
     A workaround is to structure your code using Swift Packages instead of adding files to the project itself.
