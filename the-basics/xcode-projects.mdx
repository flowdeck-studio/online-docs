## Opening Existing Projects

FlowDeck supports both `.xcworkspace` and `.xcodeproj` projects, automatically detecting build settings, schemes, and build configurations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Folder">
    File → Open Folder → Select the folder containing your `.xcworkspace` or `.xcodeproj`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Workspace & Scheme">
    The first time you open a project, FlowDeck will ask you to select your preferred workspace and scheme, then configure the project settings automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a New Project

With FlowDeck, you can create and manage Xcode projects directly from VS Code.

As you add and remove files from your sources, FlowDeck will keep your Xcode project up to date.

<Note>
  FlowDeck uses XcodeGen to create projects and schemes, keeping your project up to date as you add and edit files. For more info, check out [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
</Note>

1. Create a new folder and open it in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (`⌘⇧P`)
3. Run `FlowDeck: Create New Project`
4. Follow the prompts

### Refreshing XcodeGen Projects

You can manually refresh your FlowDeck project via the `FlowDeck: Refresh Project` command in the Command Palette (`⌘⇧P`)
