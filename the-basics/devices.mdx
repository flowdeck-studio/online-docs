</Tip>

## Debugging Method

FlowDeck automatically selects the best debugging method based on your device:

- **iOS 17+** - Uses modern `devicectl` for faster and more reliable debugging
- **iOS 16 and below** - Falls back to `ios-deploy` for compatibility
- **Auto mode** - FlowDeck automatically detects and uses the appropriate method

<Note>
  You can configure the debugging method in settings if needed, but auto mode works best for most users.
