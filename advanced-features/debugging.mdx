description: "Debug iOS and macOS applications with LLDB"
---

FlowDeck integrates with LLDB-DAP to provide a powerful debugging experience for Swift applications directly within VS Code, offering features comparable to Xcode's debugging capabilities.

## Features

- **Breakpoint Management** - Set, disable, and manage breakpoints
- **Variable Inspection** - Examine variable values during execution
- **Call Stack** - Explore threads and the entire app call stack
- **Console Output** - View application logs during debugging (OSLog)
- **Step Controls** - Step over, into, and out of functions
- **Expression Evaluation** - Evaluate Swift expressions in context

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Open your iOS project in VS Code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set breakpoints">
    Click in the gutter next to line numbers to set breakpoints
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose target">
    Select your scheme and target (simulator or device)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start debugging">
    Press `F5` and select **FlowDeck (LLDB)** from the list
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Debugging Controls

### Toolbar Actions
- **Continue** (`F5`) - Resume execution
- **Step Over** (`F10`) - Execute current line
- **Step Into** (`F11`) - Enter function calls
- **Step Out** (`⇧F11`) - Exit current function
- **Restart** (`⇧⌘F5`) - Restart debug session
- **Stop** (`⇧F5`) - End debugging

### Breakpoint Types

#### Standard Breakpoints
Click in the gutter or press `F9` on any line.

#### Conditional Breakpoints
Right-click a breakpoint and select **Edit Breakpoint**:
- **Expression** - Break when condition is true
- **Hit Count** - Break after N hits
- **Log Message** - Log without stopping execution

#### Exception Breakpoints
In the Breakpoints panel:
- Add **All Exceptions** breakpoint
- Add **Swift Error** breakpoint
- Add **Objective-C Exception** breakpoint

## Debug Console

The debug console allows you to:
- View application output
- Execute LLDB commands (prefix with `-exec`)
- Evaluate Swift expressions
- Inspect variables with `po` command

### Useful LLDB Commands

```lldb
po variableName           // Print object description
p variableName            // Print raw value
bt                        // Show backtrace
frame variable           // Show all local variables
thread list              // List all threads
```

## Variables Panel

The Variables panel shows:
- **Locals** - Variables in current scope
- **Globals** - Global variables
- **Statics** - Static variables

Right-click variables to:
- Copy value
- Copy as expression
- Add to watch
- Set value

## Watch Expressions

Add expressions to monitor:
1. Click **+** in Watch panel
2. Enter Swift expression
3. View updated values at each breakpoint

## Advanced Configuration

For custom debug configurations and launch options, see [Debug Configuration](/advanced/launch-json).

<Tip>
  Use the **Debug Console** tab during debugging to execute LLDB commands directly. Prefix commands with `-exec` for raw LLDB access.
</Tip>

## Tips for Effective Debugging

- **Use conditional breakpoints** to avoid stopping unnecessarily
- **Watch key variables** to track state changes
- **Check the call stack** to understand execution flow
- **Use log points** for non-intrusive debugging
- **Leverage LLDB commands** for advanced inspection

## Troubleshooting

### Breakpoints Not Hit
- Ensure Debug build configuration
- Check optimization settings are disabled
- Verify source maps are generated

### Variables Not Visible
- Build with debug symbols enabled
- Check you're in Debug configuration
- Ensure optimization is turned off

### Debugger Won't Attach
- Restart VS Code and simulator
- Clean build folder
- Check for conflicting debugger instances
