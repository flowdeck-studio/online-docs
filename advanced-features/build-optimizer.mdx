FlowDeck includes a Build Optimizer helper that significantly improves Xcode build performance by caching artifacts, and other build settings.

(Starting with version 0.4.5, the build optimizer is automatically installed, and does not require root access)

## Performance Impact

Typical performance improvements with the Build Optimizer (Compared to other extensions):

- **Initial Builds** - 10-20% faster
- **Incremental Builds** - Up to 30% faster
- **Clean Builds** - 15-25% faster on average

<Info>
  Actual performance gains vary based on project complexity, network conditions, and Apple's developer services responsiveness.
