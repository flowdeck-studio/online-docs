## Building for Testing

To build your application for testing without running tests:

Use the command: `FlowDeck: Build for Testing`

This compiles your application with test targets but doesn't execute the tests.

## Configuration

FlowDeck supports different test configurations through the command:

`FlowDeck: Select configuration for testing`

This allows you to choose between Debug and Release configurations for your test runs.
